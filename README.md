Survey Project in Excel

This is a survey project based on the students survey data provided by the Udacity. Here I performed 
my own data analysis and created a presentation to share that documents my findings. I started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer.Then using spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers.
