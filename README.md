This branch contains projects based on sql,tableau and microsoft excel.

The chinook .db is the database of a music store and queries related to it are present as text files with each file containing the code of the specific query along with it's code.
 
In this project,I did query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store.This project, will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
The two links above contain the queries and visual presentation after pulling the data from SQL query to successfully answer the questions.
- There are 4 unique SQL queries in this project.
- Each SQL query includes one or more explicit join. The JOIN or JOINs are necessary to the query.
- Each SQL query includes one or more aggregation.
- All visualizations make logical sense and provide accurate information about the indicated area.
- All visualizations include a title and axis labels, have a legend where applicable, and are easily understood. 
 
 
The Tableau project contains complete summary and overview of actions performed in the project along with the links attached for dashboard and story.

In this project,visualizations reveal insights from a data set.Data visualizations tell a story. My work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
The visualization includes interaction or animation. The inclusion of filters and additional variables shown in tool tip as appropriate within the visualization interaction are present.
Three visualizations are included. These visualizations are a single worksheet, dashboard and a story..All visualizations are clearly connected to a finding, and foster the interaction pieces (filters, colors, etc.) that allow for the finding to be found easily.
3 Different types of charts are used.
- Here in this project I tried to figure out the reason behind the delay in flights in the year 2015. 
- Firstly I summed up all types of delay viz. Arrival delay, security delay using the calculated field option in the first worksheet. 
- From there, applying the filter for Airline it has been found that Southwest Airlines Co.(WN) have the maximum delays.
 - After segregating the different delays, it was found that departure delay has got the maximum contribution in the total delay duration.
 - On further analysis, it has been found that airlines having destination Baltimore and Chicago were leading, that too in a particular month of the year also distance for that month was high.
 - This project has one worksheet, one dashboard and a story. 
Design:- 
- Bar chart design has been used in the initial worksheets.
 - Line design has been used to figure out the peak of delay during the entire year.
 - Apart from design filter has also been applied for various airports and airlines. 
 
Resources:- 
- This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.

Survey Project in Excel

This is a survey project based on the students survey data provided by the Udacity. Here I performed 
my own data analysis and created a presentation to share that documents my findings. I started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer.Then using spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers.
