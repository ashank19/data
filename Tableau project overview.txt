#Advanced Tableau Project

Summary:-


--> Here in this project I tried to figure out the reason behind the delay in flights in the year 2015.

--> Firstly I summed up all types of delay viz. Arrival delay, security delay using the calculated field option in the first worksheet.

--> From there, applying the filter for Airline it has been found that Southwest Airlines Co.(WN) have the maximum delays.

--> After segregating the different delays, it was found that departure delay has got the maximum contribution in the total delay duration.

--> On further analysis, it has been found that airlines having destination Baltimore and Chicago were leading, that too in a particular month of the year also distance for that month was high.

--> This project has one worksheet, one dashboard and a story.


Design:-

--> Bar chart design has been used in the initial worksheets.

--> Line design has been used to figure out the peak of delay during the entire year.

--> Apart from design filter has also been applied for various airports and airlines.


Resources:-

--> This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
